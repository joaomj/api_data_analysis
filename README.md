# **API Data Analysis**
Analyzing data from a public API.

# **The problem**

- **Data Access and Consumption:** Write a script in Python or another suitable language to access data from the selected API.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Conduct an exploratory analysis of the data to uncover patterns, trends, and useful information. This should include the use of descriptive statistics and the creation of visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and possibly maps if the data includes geographic information.
- **Insights Report:** Produce a document or presentation that highlights the key insights obtained from the analysis, emphasizing data visualizations that support these insights.
